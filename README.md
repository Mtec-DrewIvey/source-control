Welcome to my source control project!

This project is mainly intended to show my ability to navigate the CLI and use Git to navigate a project. Using git commands I cloned the repo, created different branches and committed and pushed several changes to the project. This page is hosted via Github Pages.

I used a very basic HTML structure including a header, main body and footer with some placeholder text. Styled with rudimentary CSS to center the content and update some background colors. This is a good first project for the course to provide a small showcase of current knowledge of frontend programming.
